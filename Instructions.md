## Exercise Instructions

### Implement Two New Screens
- The overall goal is to implement the two screen seen in the image in the root `Screen-Designs.png`.
 - All assets needed for the two screens are in SVG format in the folder `src/common/svg`. Please move them to where it makes the most sense.
- Make sure to use Antd library, do your best building the layout and the page exactly as in the design do not worry about the progress bar under the header.
- Show us how are you going to use state management on the form
- Use Redux to manage the global state between the two screens
- Use functional components only, donâ€™t use Class components
- Show us your project structure (directory structure), try to build at least one general component, one helper function, the routes, and the screens
- Use this endpoint: https://sprout-tech-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/village-paths-test-data/data.json to load in the data for the organization card
- To make changes to this repo first make a fork of the repo 
- Work from a feature branch, commit often, and when you are done put a pull request from your feature branch back into main on your fork
- You should not need to add any extra dependencies but if you have to please do so
- Good luck! Happy coding!
