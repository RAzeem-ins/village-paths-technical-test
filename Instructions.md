## Implement Two New Screens
- The overall goal is to implement the two screen seen in the image in the root `Screen-Designs.png`.
- All assets needed for the two screens are in SVG format in the folder `src/common/svg`. Please move them to where it makes the most sense.
- Make sure to use Antd library, do your best building the layout and the page exactly as in the design do not worry about the progress bar under the header.
- Show us how are you going to use state management on the form
- Use Redux to manage the global state between the two screens
- Use functional components only, donâ€™t use Class components
- Show us your project structure (directory structure), try to build at least one general component, one helper function, the routes, and the screens
